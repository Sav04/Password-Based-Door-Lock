# Password-Based-Door-Lock
The password-based door lock system is an advanced security device designed to prevent unauthorized access to restricted areas. This system is controlled by a microcontroller programmed to recognize only a specific binary code, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized entry. The device functions by requiring an authorized user to enter a unique password via a keypad. The microcontroller checks the entered password against its stored code, and if the password is correct, it sends a signal to unlock the door. Conversely, if the entered password is incorrect, it activates an alarm to alert of a potential breach.
This system is particularly valuable in settings like factories, laboratories, and storage facilities where access control is essential to protect sensitive materials and equipment from unauthorized use or theft. Additionally, the system offers convenient features, such as password updates, allowing users to change their passwords as needed to maintain security. It also supports multiple users, with each user assigned a unique code, providing secure access for various individuals within the organization. This enhanced design combines user flexibility with robust security, ensuring effective and reliable access control for a range of sensitive environments.
